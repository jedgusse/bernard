# "Bernard of Clairvaux and Nicholas of Montiéramey: A Stylometric Investigation into the Secretary’s Influence"

This repository comprises the code, corpora and graphs for the forthcoming article "Bernard of Clairvaux and Nicholas of Montiéramey: *A Stylometric Investigation into the Secretary’s Influence*". All texts were retrieved from the Patrologia Latina, although manual corrections in Bernard's texts were made based on Dom Jean Leclercq's editions (SBO, *Sancti Bernardi Opera*). The data placed online comprises the lemmatized texts and their PoS-tags. 

# The code: Perform_Stylometry!

The code is written in Python (prfm_stylo.py), and allows to replicate the experiments and graphs produced in the article. This code is absolutely open-source. Feel free to borrow, readjust and correct. We used two statistical techniques to structure and visualize this data. The first is **principal component analysis** (hereafter PCA), the second is ***k* Nearest Neighbours** (hereafter *k*-NN). Their respective results will prove to be similar in a general sense, yet crucially different in the details. We argue that such a double-check in visualization provides for a more accurate, nuanced interpretation and a better intuition of the data. 

Firstly, **PCA** is a technique that allows to reduce a multivariate or multidimensional dataset of many features, such as our function word frequencies, to merely 2 or 3 principal components which disregard inconsequential information or noise in the dataset and reveal its important dynamics. The assumption is that the main principal components, our axes in the plot, point in the direction of the most significant change in our data, so that clustering and outliers become clearly visible. Each word in our feature vector is assigned a weighting or loading, which reflects whether or not a word correlates highly with a PC and therefore gains importance as a discriminator in writing style. In a plot, the loadings or function words which overlap with the clustered texts of a particular author are the preferred function words of that author.  In the second visualization in this article we first calculated the 5 closest text samples to each text sample by applying ***k*-NN** on the frequency vectors.  Accordingly for each text the 5 most similar or closest texts were calculated, weighted in rank of smallest pairwise distance  and consequently mapped in space through force-directed graph drawing.  What the *k*-NN network ultimately shows is which texts are most akin – or have the closest connection – when it comes to writing style.
