# Bernard of Clairvaux and Nicholas of Montiéramey: *A Stylometric Investigation into the Secretary’s Influence*

This repository comprises the code and corpora for the forthcoming article "Bernard of Clairvaux and Nicholas of Montiéramey: *A Stylometric Investigation into the Secretary’s Influence*". All texts were retrieved from the Patrologia Latina, although manual corrections in Bernard's texts were made based on Dom Jean Leclercq's editions (SBO, *Sancti Bernardi Opera*).
